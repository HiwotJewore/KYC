‚úÖ Lab 7 ‚Äì License Validation Lambda and API Gateway Integration
In Lab 7, I created a mock backend service for validating driver‚Äôs licenses using AWS Lambda and connected it with an HTTP API using Amazon API Gateway. This simulates a third-party license verification API to support document validation in a real-world Know Your Customer (KYC) workflow.

üîß What I built
A Lambda function named ValidateLicenseLambdaFunction

A new folder: ValidateLicenseLambdaFunction/app.py

Python runtime: python3.12

The Lambda function simulates valid or invalid license checks based on an override parameter in the request body

An HTTP API using Amazon API Gateway:

Name: ValidateLicenseApi

Path: /license

Method: POST

Connected the API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function

üíª Code written in Cloud9
bash
Copy code
# Step 1: Create folder and app.py file
mkdir ValidateLicenseLambdaFunction
touch ValidateLicenseLambdaFunction/app.py

# Step 2: Python code for Lambda (ValidateLicenseLambdaFunction/app.py)
# ------------------------------------------
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    body = event['body']
    body_json = json.loads(body)
    override_parameter = body_json['validation_override']

    response = {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': override_parameter
    }
    return response
# ------------------------------------------

# Step 3: Update template.yaml to include the new Lambda and API
# (Included in Lab7 folder as template.yaml)

# Step 4: Deploy using AWS SAM
sam build && sam deploy

# Step 5: Invoke directly to test
aws lambda invoke --function-name ValidateLicenseLambdaFunction \
--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
--payload '{"body": "{\"driver_license_id\": \"S123456579010\", \"validation_override\": true}"}' response.json

cat response.json
# Output: {"statusCode": 200, "body": true}

aws lambda invoke --function-name ValidateLicenseLambdaFunction \
--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
--payload '{"body": "{\"driver_license_id\": \"S123456579010\", \"validation_override\": false}"}' response.json

cat response.json
# Output: {"statusCode": 200, "body": false}
üåê Testing via API Gateway
bash
Copy code
# Set API endpoint from deployed output
API_ENDPOINT_URL=https://52s88ikq4b.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com//license

# Valid license test
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"driver_license_id": "S123456579010", "validation_override": "True"}' $API_ENDPOINT_URL
# Output: True

# Invalid license test
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"driver_license_id": "S123456579010", "validation_override": "False"}' $API_ENDPOINT_URL
# Output: False
üìÅ Files added in Lab7/
ValidateLicenseLambdaFunction/app.py

template.yaml with the new Lambda and API definitions

‚úÖ Outcome
This lab simulated a real-world third-party license verification service using Lambda and integrated it with a RESTful HTTP API. The API Gateway successfully triggered the Lambda function with expected True and False responses, preparing the system for full KYC flow integration in the next lab.

### ‚úÖ Lab 9 ‚Äì Asynchronous Lambda Function Decomposition with Step Functions Preparation

**Goal:**  
Refactor the synchronous document Lambda function into multiple asynchronous Lambda functions orchestrated by AWS Step Functions.

**Description:**  
Decomposed the monolithic Lambda function into four smaller functions, each handling a distinct task in the onboarding workflow:

- **UnzipLambdaFunction:** Downloads and extracts zipped files from S3.
- **WriteToDynamoLambdaFunction:** Reads CSV and writes customer data to DynamoDB.
- **CompareFacesLambdaFunction:** Uses Amazon Rekognition to compare photos and updates DynamoDB.
- **CompareDetailsLambdaFunction:** Uses Amazon Textract to extract and validate license details.

**Expected Outcome:**  
- Modular, maintainable, asynchronous Lambda functions  
- Preparation for Step Functions orchestration

````markdown
## üöÄ Deployment & Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate permissions.
- AWS SAM CLI installed.
- AWS Cloud9 environment (optional but recommended).

---

### Build and Deploy All Lambda Functions

Run these commands inside your project root directory where your `template.yaml` is located:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
````

* The `--guided` flag walks you through configuration the first time.
* This will package, deploy your Lambda functions, and create/update resources on AWS.

---

### Invoke Lambda Functions Manually for Testing

You can test each Lambda function with sample payloads like these (replace `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` and function names as needed):

**UnzipLambdaFunction:**

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name UnzipLambdaFunction \
--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
--payload '{"detail": {"bucket": {"name": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"}, "object": {"key": "zipped/8d247914.zip"}}}' response1.json
cat response1.json
```

**WriteToDynamoLambdaFunction:**

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name WriteToDynamoLambdaFunction \
--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
--payload '{"detail": {"bucket": {"name": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"}}, "application": {"app_uuid": "8d247914"}}' response2.json
cat response2.json
```

**CompareFacesLambdaFunction:**

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name CompareFacesLambdaFunction \
--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
--payload '{"detail": {"bucket": {"name": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"}}, "application": {"app_uuid": "8d247914"}}' response3.json
cat response3.json
```

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name CompareDetailsLambdaFunction \
--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
--payload '{"detail": {"bucket": {"name": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"}}, "application": {"app_uuid": "8d247914"}}' response4.json
cat response4.json
```

---

### Monitor Logs

To view the logs of any Lambda function, run:

```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/<FunctionName> --follow
```

Replace `<FunctionName>` with the actual function name (e.g., `UnzipLambdaFunction`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automating Workflow with GitHub Actions (Optional)

You can automate build and deploy with this simple GitHub Actions workflow. Save this as `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in your repo:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy Lambda Functions

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up AWS CLI
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: us-west-2  # change to your region

    - name: Install AWS SAM CLI
      run: |
        sudo pip install aws-sam-cli

    - name: Build SAM app
      run: sam build

    - name: Deploy SAM app
      run: sam deploy --no-confirm-changeset --no-fail-on-empty-changeset --stack-name KYCStack --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

* Add your AWS credentials as GitHub repository secrets (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).
* Adjust region and stack name as needed.
* On every push to master, your app will build and deploy automatically.
