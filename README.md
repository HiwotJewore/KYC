**Description:**  
Decomposed the monolithic Lambda function into four smaller functions, each handling a distinct task in the onboarding workflow:

- **UnzipLambdaFunction:** Downloads and extracts zipped files from S3.
- **WriteToDynamoLambdaFunction:** Reads CSV and writes customer data to DynamoDB.
- **CompareFacesLambdaFunction:** Uses Amazon Rekognition to compare photos and updates DynamoDB.
- **CompareDetailsLambdaFunction:** Uses Amazon Textract to extract and validate license details.

**Expected Outcome:**  
- Modular, maintainable, asynchronous Lambda functions  
- Preparation for Step Functions orchestration

## Deployment and Testing

- IAM roles and permissions are preconfigured for each Lambda function.
- Use the AWS CLI or Cloud9 environment to invoke functions with sample payloads for testing.
- Deploy Lambda functions using the following commands inside your Cloud9 terminal:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy
````

* Monitor Lambda function logs with:

```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/<FunctionName>
```

---

## Repo Structure (Example)

```

````markdown
## üöÄ Deployment & Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate permissions.
- AWS SAM CLI installed.
- AWS Cloud9 environment (optional but recommended).

---

### Build and Deploy All Lambda Functions

Run these commands inside your project root directory where your `template.yaml` is located:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
````

* The `--guided` flag walks you through configuration the first time.
* This will package, deploy your Lambda functions, and create/update resources on AWS.

---

### Invoke Lambda Functions Manually for Testing

You can test each Lambda function with sample payloads like these (replace `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` and function names as needed):

**UnzipLambdaFunction:**

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name UnzipLambdaFunction \
--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
--payload '{"detail": {"bucket": {"name": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"}, "object": {"key": "zipped/8d247914.zip"}}}' response1.json
cat response1.json
```

**WriteToDynamoLambdaFunction:**

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name WriteToDynamoLambdaFunction \
--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
--payload '{"detail": {"bucket": {"name": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"}}, "application": {"app_uuid": "8d247914"}}' response2.json
cat response2.json
```

**CompareFacesLambdaFunction:**

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name CompareFacesLambdaFunction \
--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
--payload '{"detail": {"bucket": {"name": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"}}, "application": {"app_uuid": "8d247914"}}' response3.json
cat response3.json
```

**CompareDetailsLambdaFunction:**

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name CompareDetailsLambdaFunction \
--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
--payload '{"detail": {"bucket": {"name": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"}}, "application": {"app_uuid": "8d247914"}}' response4.json
cat response4.json
```

---

### Monitor Logs

To view the logs of any Lambda function, run:

```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/<FunctionName> --follow
```

Replace `<FunctionName>` with the actual function name (e.g., `UnzipLambdaFunction`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automating Workflow with GitHub Actions (Optional)

You can automate build and deploy with this simple GitHub Actions workflow. Save this as `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in your repo:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy Lambda Functions

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up AWS CLI
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: us-west-2  # change to your region

    - name: Install AWS SAM CLI
      run: |
        sudo pip install aws-sam-cli

    - name: Build SAM app
      run: sam build

    - name: Deploy SAM app
      run: sam deploy --no-confirm-changeset --no-fail-on-empty-changeset --stack-name KYCStack --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

* Add your AWS credentials as GitHub repository secrets (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).
* Adjust region and stack name as needed.
* On every push to master, your app will build and deploy automatically.
